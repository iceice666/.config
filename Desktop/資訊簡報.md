# NeoVim

Neovim is a project that seeks to aggressively refactor Vim in order to:
- Simplify maintenance and encourage contributions
- Split the work between multiple developers
- Enable advanced UIs without modifications to the core
- Maximize extensibility

## Features

### Extensible
- API is first-class: discoverable, versioned, documented.
- MessagePack structured communication enables extensions in any language.
- Remote plugins run as co-processes, safely and asynchronously.
- GUIs, IDEs, web browsers can --embed Neovim as an editor or script host.
- Lua plugins are easy to create just like Vimscript plugins. Your config can live in init.lua!
- AST-producing parsing engine enables faster, more accurate syntax highlighting, code navigation, refactoring, text objects, and motions.
### Usable
- Builtin LSP client for semantic code inspection and refactoring (go-to definition, "find references", format, â€¦)
- Strong defaults
- Works the same everywhere: one build-type, one command
- Modern terminal features such as cursor styling, focus events, bracketed paste
- Builtin terminal emulator
### Drop-in Vim
- Fully compatible with Vim's editing model and Vimscript v1.
- Start with :help nvim-from-vim if you already use Vim.
